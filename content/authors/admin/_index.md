      My PhD thesis work on HIV-1 latency exit has been recognized with the Best Interdisciplinary Thesis award by the CollÃ¨ge Doctoral of University of Montpellier. In this project, I explored how HIV wakes up from its dormant state, a question that led me down a path combining biology, live-cell imaging, mathematical and statistical modeling, and computer vision. It was truly an interdisciplinary effort, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work at the intersection of these fields.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
