      subtitle: ''

        I'm a research scientist. I blog about Computer Vision, Image Analysis, and Crochet.

        As a doctoral student at Institut de GÃ©nÃ©tique Humaine, I conducted cutting-edge research in the field of transcription dynamics, applying my skills in Python, R, and MATLAB to analyze large and complex datasets. I have a master's degree in physics and a postgraduate diploma in statistics, which give me a strong foundation in quantitative and computational methods. I have over six years of work experience in various research settings, including Institut de GÃ©nÃ©tique MolÃ©culaire de Montpellier and Amity University, where I participated in multiple projects on topics such as gene regulation, transcriptional noise and cancer. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and interactions that shape human health and disease, and I am eager to collaborate with other researchers and experts in this field. I value curiosity, innovation, and diversity, and I strive to contribute to the scientific community and society with my work.
