abstract: "BACKGROUND: The breast cancer subtype deficient in estrogen receptor and
  human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (ER-/HER2-) displays enhanced aggressiveness,
  metastasis and disease relapse due to chemoresistance. ER-/HER2- patients lack molecularly
  targeted treatment hence, new therapeutic and prognostic biomarkers are required
  for better patient management. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognostic role of
  protein tyrosine phosphatase genes in Breast Cancer and their relevance as predictive
  markers for chemoresistance. METHODS: We examined the expression of 114 protein
  tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) genes in 1700 breast cancer patient's tumor samples with
  respect to ER-/HER2- subtype. Correlation of relevant candidates with chemoresistance
  was analyzed in breast cancer cells resistant to taxane/anthracycline based drugs.
  The prognostic value of key candidates was assessed using Kaplan Meier plots and
  Nottingham prognostic index and expression pattern was confirmed using qRT-PCR.
  The epigenetic regulation was analyzed using ChIP-Seq datasets. By plotting ROC
  plots, clinical outcome after treatment with taxane and anthracycline was established.
  RESULTS: Overexpression of CDC25A and CDC25C and under-expression of DUSP16 was
  observed in tumor samples of ER-/HER2- patients and breast cancer cells. Similar
  expression patterns of these candidate genes were observed in MCF7 cells resistant
  to paclitaxel and adriamycin and also correlated with poor prognosis of breast cancer
  patients. Increased CDC25A and CDC25C in ER-/HER2- cells was found to be regulated
  epigenetically by histone H3K4 methylation. Overall, the present study establishes
  increased expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase CDC25C as a poor prognostic
  marker for breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the role of CDC25C in
  chemoresistance to taxane and anthracycline based therapy and proposes CDC25C as
  a potential predictive marker for these cancer therapies."
