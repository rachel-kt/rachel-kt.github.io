 abstract = {BACKGROUND: High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) accounts for nearly 60% of total cases of epithelial ovarian cancer. It is the most aggressive subtype, which shows poor prognosis and low patient survival. For better management of HGSOC patients, new prognostic biomarkers are required to facilitate improved treatment strategies and ensure suitable healthcare decisions.
METHODS: We performed genome wide expression analysis of HGSOC patient samples to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using R based Limma package, Clust and other statistical tools. The identified DEGs were subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify co-expression patterns of relevant genes. Module trait and gene ontology analyses were performed to establish important gene co-expression networks and their biological functions. Overlapping the most relevant DEG cluster 4 with prominent WGCNA cyan module identified strongest correlation of UBE2Q1 with ovarian cancer and its prognostic significance on survival probability of ovarian cancer patients was investigated. The predictive value of UBE2Q1 as a potential biomarker was analysed by correlating its expression with 12-months relapse free survival of patients in response to platin/taxane, the standard first-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, and analysing area under the ROC curve.
RESULTS: An integrated gene expression analysis and WGCNA, identified UBE2Q1 as a potential prognostic marker associated with poor relapse-free survival and response outcome to platin/taxane treatment of patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a potential UBE2Q1 - B4GALT3 functional axis in ovarian cancer, where only the E2 conjugating enzyme showed a poor prognostic impact on the disease.},
