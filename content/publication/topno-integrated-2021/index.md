abstract: 'BACKGROUND: High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) accounts for nearly
  60% of total cases of epithelial ovarian cancer. It is the most aggressive subtype,
  which shows poor prognosis and low patient survival. For better management of HGSOC
  patients, new prognostic biomarkers are required to facilitate improved treatment
  strategies and ensure suitable healthcare decisions. METHODS: We performed genome
  wide expression analysis of HGSOC patient samples to identify differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) using R based Limma package, Clust and other statistical tools. The
  identified DEGs were subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
  to identify co-expression patterns of relevant genes. Module trait and gene ontology
  analyses were performed to establish important gene co-expression networks and their
  biological functions. Overlapping the most relevant DEG cluster 4 with prominent
  WGCNA cyan module identified strongest correlation of UBE2Q1 with ovarian cancer
  and its prognostic significance on survival probability of ovarian cancer patients
  was investigated. The predictive value of UBE2Q1 as a potential biomarker was analysed
  by correlating its expression with 12-months relapse free survival of patients in
  response to platin/taxane, the standard first-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer,
  and analysing area under the ROC curve. RESULTS: An integrated gene expression analysis
  and WGCNA, identified UBE2Q1 as a potential prognostic marker associated with poor
  relapse-free survival and response outcome to platin/taxane treatment of patients
  with high grade serous ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a potential
  UBE2Q1 - B4GALT3 functional axis in ovarian cancer, where only the E2 conjugating
  enzyme showed a poor prognostic impact on the disease.'
