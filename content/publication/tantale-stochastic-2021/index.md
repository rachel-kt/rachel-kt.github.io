abstract: Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II is a key process regulating
  gene expression. In latent HIV-1 cells, it prevents viral transcription and is essential
  for latency maintenance, while in acutely infected cells the viral factor Tat releases
  paused polymerase to induce viral expression. Pausing is fundamental for HIV-1,
  but how it contributes to bursting and stochastic viral reactivation is unclear.
  Here, we performed single molecule imaging of HIV-1 transcription. We developed
  a quantitative analysis method that manages multiple time scales from seconds to
  days and that rapidly fits many models of promoter dynamics. We found that RNA polymerases
  enter a long-lived pause at latent HIV-1 promoters (textgreater20 minutes), thereby
  effectively limiting viral transcription. Surprisingly and in contrast to current
  models, pausing appears stochastic and not obligatory, with only a small fraction
  of the polymerases undergoing long-lived pausing in absence of Tat. One consequence
  of stochastic pausing is that HIV-1 transcription occurs in bursts in latent cells,
  thereby facilitating latency exit and providing a rationale for the stochasticity
  of viral rebounds.
