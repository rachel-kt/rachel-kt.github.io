abstract: Monitoring transcription in living cells gives access to the dynamics of
  this complex fundamental process. It reveals that transcription is discontinuous,
  whereby active periods (bursts) are separated by one or several types of inactive
  periods of distinct lifetimes. However, decoding temporal fluctuations arising from
  live imaging and inferring the distinct transcriptional steps eliciting them is
  a challenge. We present BurstDECONV, a novel statistical inference method that deconvolves
  signal traces into individual transcription initiation events. We use the distribution
  of waiting times between successive polymerase initiation events to identify mechanistic
  features of transcription such as the number of rate-limiting steps and their kinetics.
  Comparison of our method to alternative methods emphasizes its advantages in terms
  of precision and flexibility. Unique features such as the direct determination of
  the number of promoter states and the simultaneous analysis of several potential
  transcription models make BurstDECONV an ideal analytic framework for live cell
  transcription imaging experiments. Using simulated realistic data, we found that
  our method is robust with regards to noise or suboptimal experimental designs. To
  show its generality, we applied it to different biological contexts such as Drosophila
  embryos or human cells.
